	Connect nodejs with MongoDB database, then find and retrieve data. 
    Next, using nodejs syntax to create a new json or txt file and write these data into it. 
    After that, use JavaScript fetch API, or Ajax to connect to this JSON or txt file,
     then retrieve data and display it into any element in HTML file

*In this document, I’m going to present method 3*

*I got 4 files for this example, “test1.html”, “test2.html”, “test2.js”,
 and  “Userdata1_mongoDB.json”*. 

“test2.js” file hold Node.js syntax to connect with MongoDB database, html page, read,
 create, and write content inside JSON file

“test1.html” hold form syntax for user to register

“test2.html” hold table syntax to display user information data, and AJAX syntax to parse 
and retrieve data from JSON file

The “Userdata1_mongoDB.json” JSON file is an empty file that is used to wait for user
 to register their account information in order to write these information into it.
  After this step finish, test2.html will be opened and present user information on it




//output from console or terminal must be like the example below

PS C:\xampp\htdocs\web_develop_project> node test2.js
Running server on PORT 8080...
{ name_input: 'FGTRHPKBNM', email_input: 'FGTRHPKBNM@outlook.com' }

                 !!!We have a new user register our page.!!!
                 !!!User's data have been inserted to MongoDB Database!!!
Successfully writting content to Userdata1_mongoDB.json!!!
